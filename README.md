Here you can create a simple log for short/individual travels that you want to create a log for. (country -> country / city -> city)
- Start by giving your travel a unique name, select the date when your journey took place. For instance, "Spain - Madrid" | 05.09.2023 - 07.09.2023".
- On the right side, we can see a colored checkerboard. Here you can choose your preferred color and opacity that you want to highlight the specific country with.
- When you've set everything up, your final step is to choose 1 of 8 available travel types. Then start placing markers on the map to trace your path and adventures.
- Once you've finished, just hit the "✔️" button to confirm creating your travel log.

Here you can create a whole travel log group for much bigger travels, that includes multiple individual travel logs, spanning across multiple days or countries.
- The provess is familiar, begin with naming your group travel log, and set a date. For instance, "Europe Tour 2023 | 10.09.2023 - 20.09.2023". <br />
- Hit the "✔️" button to confirm your choice.

### **Step 2: Add Sub Travels to Your Main Log**

- For each Main log of the "Europe Tour 2023" adventure, create individual sub-travels using the ➕ button in the main log. Similar to the main log, provide a name and date for each sub-travel.
But this time you can choose the type of transportation you used for each sub-travel. Plus, you can customize the way countries are highlighted on the map by picking colors and adjusting opacity.
- Once you've set everything up, start placing markers on the map by simply clicking with the Left Mouse Button (LMB) and then confirming your selection with the ✓ button.

And don't worry, if you happen to make a mistake while creating either a main or sub-travel log, simply click the "❌" button to clear your current input and start fresh.
